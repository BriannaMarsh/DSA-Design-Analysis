# DSA-Design-Analysis

  With the projects in this course, I was moreso filling a gap, rather than solving a problem. In this course, we were working with a company called DriverPass, where it was their life mission to make it easier for drivers to get their licesnse on the first try. They provided materials and resources to help them succeed in this field. We approached the problem by initially interviewing the director and his team to ensure we were going to come up with the best service for them. I overcame my personal radblocks with these projects by taking a break away from the computer to give my eyes a break. Once I returned back to the screen, I returned with a fresh pair of eyes and ready to conquer. 
  The work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by learning about the different sorts and implementing texts in visual studios. My work on this project has made me more detailed when I code and with my inline comments.
