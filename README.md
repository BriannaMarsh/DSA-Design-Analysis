# DSA-Design-Analysis

  With the projects in this course, I was moreso filling a gap, rather than solving a problem. In this course, we were working with computer science advisors to make it easier for them to see all of the courses for the program and all of the prerequisites, as well as being in alphanumeric order. I overcame my personal radblocks with these projects by taking a break away from the computer to give my eyes a break. Once I returned back to the screen, I returned with a fresh pair of eyes and ready to conquer. 
  The work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by learning about the different sorts and implementing texts in visual studios. My work on this project has made me more detailed when I code and with my inline comments.
